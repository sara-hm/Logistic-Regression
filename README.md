# Logistic-Regression

This project explores logistic regression and the regularization/penalty (l1 and l2) in logistic regression by designing a logistic regression algorithm to classify bank notes as genuite or forged using the dataset provided by the UCI Maching Learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#. Comparison with KNN is also briefly described in the report.
